# a Great Presentation
### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Great presenters use fewer slides — and fewer words
It’s no coincidence that some of the most memorable speeches and documents in history are among the shortest. The Gettysburg Address is 272 words, John F. Kennedy’s inauguration speech was under 15 minutes, and the Declaration of Independence guarantees three unalienable rights — not 22.

## Great presenters don’t use bullet points
Bullet points are the least effective way to get your point across. Take Steve Jobs, considered to be one of the most extraordinary presenters of his time. He rarely showed slides with just text and bullets. He used photos and text instead.

## Great presenters enhance their vocal delivery
Speakers who vary the pace, pitch, and volume of their voices are more effective, according to a research study by Wharton marketing professor, Jonah Berger.

In summary, the research states that effective persuaders modulate their voice, and by doing so, appear to be more confident in their argument. For example, they raise their voice when emphasizing a key message, or they pause after delivering an important point.

Simply put, if you raise and lower the volume of your voice, and alternate between a high pitch and low pitch while delivering key messages, your presentation will be more influential, persuasive, and commanding.

## Great presenters create “wow” moments
People don’t remember every slide and every word of a presentation. They remember moments!

Unexpected moments grab an audience’s attention because the human brain gets bored easily.

“Novelty recognition is a hardwired survival tool all humans share. Our brains are trained to look for something brilliant and new, something that stands out, something that looks delicious.”
