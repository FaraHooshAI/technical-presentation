# How to deliver a technical presentation to a non-technical audience!

### Estimated time: 0.5h

Although great presentations are a mix of education, communication, and collaboration, in the end, they all boil down to persuasion!

“Executives don’t really care about the bits and bytes. They want to know why they should care,” says Alissa Knight, previously a security analyst specializing in financial sector security.

“Avoid getting too much into the how,” Knight adds. “Leave the how out. They care about the what.”

Harwell Thrasher, author of **Boiling the IT Frog** : “Tech people fall in love with features but the actual benefits of the technology are what’s important.” 

### Keep it short!
Some technical presenters check their urge to splurge by only addressing “what” their idea will accomplish, rather than the “how”.

And of course, you can save words and pack a stronger punch by incorporating visual elements into your presentation. **Images** can be a powerful way to help listeners picture the results that you’re promising in vivid detail.

### Omit needless buzzwords!
When you decide to include technical terms, explain what each term means the first time you use it. If it’s usually spoken as an acronym, introduce both the term and its shortcut (“To communicate with the other system, we use an application programmer interface – it’s called an API”) so that the listeners don’t get lost trying to keep track. 

### Did they understand you?
Pay close attention to the audience’s response. Find out if you’re reaching them. 

Recognize that the audience may be embarrassed about its ignorance, particularly if they are accomplished people who don’t want to look dumb in front of professional colleagues. “Pass out note cards that people can write questions on,” advises telco and antitrust attorney Paul Overbite. Even if they’re embarrassed, he says, “They'll write down their questions as an anonymous note.”

### Don’t forget the takeaway!
There’s a reason you’re making this presentation. Make sure it’s clear to the audience what that reason is, and explicitly state the one thing you want them to understand by the end.

Be clear about what you want. Even if you don’t succeed in enlightening the audience about the technology, you might convey your dedication and passion enough to sell them on giving you your heart’s desire. The listener may not end up understanding network topology, but she may conclude that you know – and that your opinion can be trusted. 

For example, when Bartlett needed to upgrade some business systems, he ignored any presentation of the underlying algorithm. “We just focused on the solution. We showed a graph, and then another graph on what would happen if we implemented to the solution. Then we had to discuss what it would take and how many people it would take. Because we had the graphs, it was easy to get past it.”
